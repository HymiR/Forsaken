Forsaken
========

The legendary and forsaken 6dof game "Forsaken",
originally distributed by Acclaim which sadly went bankrupt in 2004
and was liquidated in 2010.
In 1998 they released a "six-degree-of-freedom" 3D FPS called Forsaken
(developed under the code name projectX).

The game itself is now abandonware, but the source was not publically released,
which is the reason we want to reimplement it on the multiplattform 3D engine
Ogre3d using the existing resources.
